## Description

### Background

carSHAiR is a peer to peer car sharing platform with a mission to bring high tech solutions to provide an exceptional experience for Guests and Hosts within the car sharing space.

As a peer to peer car sharing platform, vehicle hosts need a way to advertise their cars listed on the platform to potential guests.

### Objectives

As a frontend developer, it is your task to create a user interface that displays cars listed on the platform in which users can search, filter, and browse.

Normally, a set of UI mockups are designed and shared with the frontend team. For the purposes of this assessment, UI mockups are not provided. As a frontend developer on this task, you have full creative freedom to design the interface.

### Scope Clarifications & Requirements

- Use fake car data (car details & images) to populate the UI
  - See the resources section on APIs for random car data & images
  - Assume the "price" property on the fake car data represents the daily rental rate ($/day)
- Simple text matching for the text search feature is sufficient
- Filters must be fully functional

  - At a minimum, the user must be able to filter by car make, year, and color
  - Feel free to add range sliders for the filters (not required, but extra points)

- Amazing UI/UX
  - Intuitive - is it easy to use?
  - Comprehensive - does the UI draw users' attention to particular focus areas?
  - Design - does it look nice?

### Constraints

- Must use React Native + Expo
  - (Optional) TypeScript

### Submission Requirements
